Cabaret Club Manager (CCM)
Solo Developer | Mobile/PC Live-Service Game Project | 2024–Present

Overview
CCM is a management-simulation and competitive strategy game blending narrative, PvE, and PvP systems. Designed as a live-service title, it integrates simulation mechanics, player customisation, and an evolving story world. Developed independently to demonstrate expertise in full-stack game development, systems design, and cross-disciplinary creative production.

This is a prototype with a lot of features stripped down to basics to expand upon later. For example, there is no clothing for customisation, but there is code that shows the intention to have lots of options to equip clothing and mix and match items.
